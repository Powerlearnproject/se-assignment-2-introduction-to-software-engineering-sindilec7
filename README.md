# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
is the branch of computers science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintainance of the software appications

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
is a structured process that enables the production of high quality, low cost software, in the shortest possible production time.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The agile model refers to the iterative approach to delivering a software product. the agile model prioritzes teamwork and discussions instead of procedural operations.
The waterfall model is a linear application developmentthat uses the rigid phases. when one phase ends the other begins.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The Waterfall Model
The water fall model is a linear system of working that require the team to complte each other project phase before moving to the next one.
waterfall has a fixed timeline.
waterfall is not flexibile as Agile.
waterfall model do not involve clients in the development of the project.

Agile Model encourages the team to work simultaneously on duffernt phases of the project.
Agile is a lot flexible and accounts for experimenting with different directions.
Agile leaves aroom to adapt and change course as the project develops.
the foundamental part of Agile Model is including clients in the project development at every step.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

The software development lifecycle is the cost effective and time effecient process that development team use to design and build high quality software.

Software Development life cycle consist of various phases:
Planning. the team determine the cost and the resources required for implementing the analysed requirments.

Design. the SDLC starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan called design specification.

Build. in this phase they create what they want, the actual development start.

Coding Test. in this stage test for defects and deficiencies. fix the issues until the prodcut meets the original specifications.

Deployment. at this stage the goal is to deploy the software to the production environment so users can start using the product.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity is a foundamental design principle in software engineering aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of the system.
This helps to localisethe impact of changes, simplifies maintainance, and enhances the understandability of the system.
Modularity in computing and programming refers to dividing a system into separate modules or components.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing is a type of software testing in which individual units or components of the software are tested.
The main objectve of unit testing is to isolate each component of the software and then perform tests to illustrate that every individual component is accurately meeting the requirements and delivering the expected output.

Integration testing is a type of software testing in which individual software components are logicaly integrated and tested as a group.
The main objective of integrated testing is to verify whether individual modules when combined work correctly or not as a group.

System testing is software testing in which all components are tested together to ensure that the final product meets the specified requirements.
The objective of the level of testing is to make sure that the software or product meets the specifies requirements and runs a ssmoothly as possible in its operating environment.

Acceptance Testing is the type of software testing that determines whether or not the software shoukd be released to the public
The main objective of acceptance testing is to evaluate whether or not the software complies with the end user requirements and whether is ready for deployment.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version Control Systems are software tools that helps software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Version Control Sytems offer several benefits for software development, including improved collaboratio, reduced errors, better code quality and the ability to track changes.
They also allow for more accessible code reviews and facilitate code sharing between team members.

Examples of version control systems.
Git - you can use Git to manage the version of your computer programs and work on programs in conjunction with other developers.

Subversion

Mercurial

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Software project manager are in charge of the planning , scheduling , budgeting, execution, and delivery of software and web projects.
They ensure the successful completion of all software projects and also oversee the people performing work on the projects.

challenges faced managing software projects
poor communication 
unclear goals 
lack of accountability
insufficient risk management
poor budgeting

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.

Different types of maintenance
Corrective software maintenance - fixing defects
Adaptive software maintenance -adapting to the environment
Perfective software maintenance
preventative software maintenance.

maintaenance is essential part of the software lifestyle

To ensures that software remains effective, secure and reliable over time.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?
weak security
wrong priorities
algorithmic bias
unethical data collection
 How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
